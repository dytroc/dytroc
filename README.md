# Dytro
I am Dytro, a high school sophomore in Korea.

My current affiliation includes [Komtents](https://github.com/Komtents) and [MC-Dashify](https://github.com/MC-Dashify). 

I hope for a better open source community where everybody could commit freely regardless of their age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and social status.
